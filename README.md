The dataset is taken from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html


**Problem Setting**
Amazon is the worldâ€™s largest e-commerce platform. Over the decade, it has become a staple at every household for anything one wants to purchase online. It offers millions of reviews to help us make the right choice of products. Users (Buyers) often make the transaction after reading/watching several reviews. The review system is rating based, wherein buyers post their feedback, rating and images about the product purchased.

**Problem Definition**
As a new customer on an e-commerce platform, it can be difficult to decide amongst products belonging under the same category. For example, to select a shoe online as there are multiple deciding parameters like price, brand, size availability etc. Generally, users choose products based on price, customer ratings, shipping/arrival time etc. however it can get quite confusing sometimes as there are multiple deciding factors involved and a plethora of options to choose from.

**Recommender systems are information filtering systems that helps establish a relationship between user and products to maximize customer product interaction. These systems take inputs from user reviews, feedbacks, search history and user-user interactions as well. Our primary objective will be to predict future buys of a customer based on the items that customer has already purchased and his/her reviews about the purchased items. We also aim to develop a recommendation system by utilizing Amazon.com reviews to predict top 5 items in each category using machine learning models.**
